<div class="column">
Task 2

<ul>
<li>The ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù title should stretch the entire width of the row.</li>
<li>The ‚ÄúOur History‚Äù part should occupy only half the width of the row for small to extra

</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Task 3

In this task you will use some responsive utilities provided by Bootstrap to hide some of the content only for extra small screens. You will make use of the hidden-* CSS classes provided by Bootstrap. To understand how to use these classes, please read the documentation here to learn how to apply the hidden-* classes. This will get you into the habit of consulting the Bootstrap documentation whenever you need to learn more about the various components and classes of

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Bootstrap. You should apply the classes so that the detailed descriptions of the corporate leadership is hidden only for extra small screens. Thus, your page should look like the figure below on extra small screens.

NOTE: Beginning with Boostrap v4.0.0. beta, the classes .hidden-* classes were completely removed (yes, they were replaced by hidden-*-* but those classes are also gone from v4 alphas). Starting with v4-beta, you can combine .d-*-none and .d-*-block classes to achieve the same result. As shown in here

<div class="page" title="Page 5"></div>
<div class="page" title="Page 6">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
More details about the hidden-* classes can be found at http://v4- alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/responsive-utilities/.

While you are at it, please also apply the hidden-* classes to the descriptions in the index.html page. This is not part of the assignment, but should be completed to update your website.
